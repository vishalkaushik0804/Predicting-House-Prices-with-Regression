It is a trained Neural Network model that will be able to predict House Prices with Regression using Keras and TensorFlow.
It takes some information like the age of the house, geographical location as input and predicts the price of a house 
This model is based on Keras with TensorFlow as its backend and use it to solve a  a basic regression problem.
Steps to solve the Problem:
1. Create, train and evaluate neural network models.
2. Use neural networks to solve regression problems.
